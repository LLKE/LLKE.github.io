Welcome! My name is Laurens Keuker.

Aspiring Autonomous Systems Engineer
------------------------------------------

I'm an electrical engineering, information technology, and computer science student at RWTH Aachen University. Since I started programming in my second semester, I've become somewhat addicted. I've worked various student assistant jobs, in which I was able to deepen my knowledge in e.g. C++ and Python. Feel free to take a look at my resume for more information! Currently, I am working part time as a research and development engineer at [Jedsy](https://jedsy.com/), an autonomous drone delivery company. My strongest fascination is directed towards autonomous vehicles of any kind and how they can be used to positively impact Earth and its people. I also dedicate some of my free time to learning as much as I can about related topics, interesting software and computer science subjects and anything to do with automation and robotics.

**My dream is to use my skillset to make the world a greener, healthier and safer place.**
