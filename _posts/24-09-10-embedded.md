## Why I Wanted To

As may be clear from other posts on this website, I love programming. I discovered this passion during my studies and especially during my Formula Student times. I discovered that this passion is especially focussed on autonomous systems, rather than web or app development. 

When I started down the path of autonomous systems engineering, and still today, the main focus of my engineering journey has been software in the area of guidance and navigation, along with some computer vision. This came about when I joined the driverless software team of the Ecurie Aix Formula Student team. 

I joined at the same time as a good friend of mine, and he went the more "logical" electrical engineering route, and became, well, an electrical engineer in the same team. Why is this the more logical route? My background explains why. I am, at heart, an electrical engineer. I started studying electrical engineering at RWTH Aachen University in 2016. 

And while I have absolutely found my place in the guidance and navigation area of autonomous systems, there has always been a part of me that was being pulled towards lower level electrical engineering and embedded systems engineering, which of course represented a large part of my studies. I find that understanding the foundations of how the software that I write works on a very low level makes everything seem like __sliiightly__ less black magic to me.

Therefore, I also believe that having at least a basic practical understanding of circuits, sensors, microcontrollers and hardware in general is essential for the autonomous systems engineer that I aspire to become, as these often comprise the very foundation of what the autonomous system will be running on. And it's also just highly interesting. Who doesn't want to build cool robots that drive around the apartment?

## Finally Starting My Embedded Journey

So now I have finally gotten around to it. It has taken only eight years. But rather late than never, right? Come along, and I will share what I learned. Maybe I can help smoothen your path a little while I'm at it.

## My First Project - A Self-Balancing Robot

Now, of course, being someone that is most intrigued by systems that do things by themselves (i.e. autonomous systems), I didn't just want to build a remote controlled robot. I saw the opportunity to get some practical experience on the mystical and crucial topic that is control. Something I have spent (and will still spend) months intensively studying for on paper during my studies, but have never actually used in a practical sense. 

So I decided that my very first project should be a **self-balancing robot**.
