During my Bachelor's degree at RWTH Aachen University I decided to volunteer at Ecurie Aix. This is which is the university's Formula Student team. Formula Student is a competition, in which universities all around the world compete to build the best formula-style racing car and to research and learn about the future of motor sports. Part of this competition is the driverless division. Using sensors, software and an autonomous processing unit, the vehicle is therefore enabled to race entirely autonomously, without previously knowing the race track. In this team, I was responsible for the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system of the vehicle. A successful and effective solution was achieved. Through this, I gained experience working in a team to develop a complex project combining hardware and software from the ground up.
