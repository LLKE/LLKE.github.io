## What is Formula Student?

![Alt Text](media/ecurie/eace08.jpg)

Formula Student is a global engineering competition in which university students design, build, and race formula-style cars. The competition challenges teams to showcase their technical skills, innovation, and teamwork.

The goal of Formula Student is to provide students with hands-on experience in engineering, project management, and teamwork. It allows them to apply their theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges and gain practical skills that are highly valued in the automotive industry.

Participating teams are required to design and manufacture their own vehicle, considering factors such as aerodynamics, chassis design, powertrain, suspension, electronics, performance, cost, and, as of the past few years, the autonomous driving system. This is taken under close scrutiny by professionals from the automotive world, and forms part of the competition outcome, next to the actual spectacular racing events. They also need to develop a business plan and present it to a panel of judges, demonstrating their understanding of the market and financial aspects of the project. More details can be found [here](https://www.ecurie-aix.de/en/about-us/competition/formula-student).

Formula Student competitions take place all around the world, attracting teams from prestigious universities and technical institutions. It is a platform for students to network with industry professionals and showcase their talents. One of the biggest Formula Student competitions is the [Formula Student Germany](https://www.formulastudent.de/fsg/), whose 2019 event also formed the pinnacle of my time in Formula Student.


## My Formula Student Journey  

### How It All Started

When I started studying in 2016, I immediately felt that it was not enough. I was learning how to look at electric circuits on paper. I was learning how to write programs. On paper. It dawned on me that once I try to start earning money in the automation sector, I would sit there with a task from my employer and not be able to even comprehend what I am required to do. Not to mention ever starting a business on my own. 

So when, in my fourth semester, a friend of mine came along with the proposition of joining this crazy competition, where highly intelligent students build space-ship-esque racing cars accelerating to 100km/h in three seconds, I decided that this was exactly what I was looking for. I felt like I had absolutely no merit to even apply, but what did I have to lose? Especially when considering the fact, that this formula student team from Aachen, aptly named *<a href="#" class="magic-button" title="Fr.: Racing horse stable">Ecurie </a> <a href="#" class="magic-button" title="Fr.: Aachen">Aix</a>*, was in the process of building up a group to equip one of their older vehicles to race autonomously, and they happened to be looking for a software developer, I decided that this was right down my alley. Note: I was not a software developer. All experience I had were a tiny bit of C++ I learned during labs at the university, and whatever I had programmed on paper. But as this role was pretty much exactly in line with my passions for "anything that does things by itself", I applied.

### Becoming a Driverless Software Engineer

So there I was, in *Ecurie Aix's* workshop, sitting face to face with the group leader of the driverless group. I was honest about my experience. But he was positively convinced by my guarantee that I could learn whatever I had to to fulfil my tasks. And as the driverless group currently consisted only of a very small number of people (3), and there were many roles to be filled, I was given the chance. Knowing little of the driverless pipeline as of then, and given my lack of experience in software, I was given the small and simple task of creating a simultaneous localization and mapping system for the vehicle. *Disclaimer:* It was not simple.
