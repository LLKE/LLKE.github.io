I have FOMO. Fear Of Missing Out. And a lot of it. This is how I got around it and avoided burning out. And how it made me passionate for boring stuff.

Even though this particular story is about tech, I believe this way of shifting perspective applies to many areas in life

Why do I have FOMO?

I'm a person who has found their passion in tech. This is the passion I am working hard towards making my career. 
Now I do have a specific topic that the main magnet of my passion: Autonomous systems, more specifically: Guidance and Navigation. Deep down, I have known this
since I started studying. Actually, much earlier already. However, it took me long to find out. I was a four year old child when I first ushered the wish to become a pilot. 
When I got older, that wish remained, only the domain changed from wanting to pilot the plane myself to wanting my software to pilot the plane. But that wish
took a long time to crystallize. Through years of studying during my bachelor's and master's degree, through multiple different student jobs working with autonomous
cars, drones and robot arms, there was so much input that my brain had latched onto about 37 different topics that it wanted to learn about and deemed necessary 
for my career. As I said, I knew I wanted to be in tech. And diffusely, I knew I wanted to be an autonomous systems engineer. But I wasn't able to focus because 
there were so many different aspects of tech that shouted for my attention. 

## How This Almost Burned Me Out

Now that my story-about-not-knowing-where-my-passions-lie-even-though-deep-down-in-my-heart-I-have-always-known is out of the way, let's jump to the recent past, more 
specifically, the first part of this year. 

I've never been someone to really buy into new years resolutions. This year was more or less the same. However due to an upcoming internship I had to do as 
part of my master's programme, I was becoming excited to finally experience the real world of engineering that I had been working toward for the past couple
of years. I was so ready to get out of the day to day strut of going to lecures, falling asleep and frantically trying to learn everything necessary to pass 
the exam at the end of the semester, even though I had vowed to keep up during the semester. I started getting ahead of myself, updating my CV and giving it a much
needed facelift, writing multiple cover letters and just diving into the world of exiting companies I might do my internship at. Seeing all the amazing opportunities
out there, I was excited to start learning all about possible topics that I might encounter along the way. Robotics. Control. Navigation. DevOps. Linux. The list goes on and on.


+ Me doing all sorts of different side projects, courses, trying to do open source stuff, wanting to learn cyber security etc. 
+ Brain completely overwhelmed by all the stuff I wanted to do next to actually studying and getting my degree
+ Doing LinkedIn, wanting to write articles about my learnings
+ Almost burning out
+ New semester, wanting to finish my masters within a year

## Re-Framing Studying as a Project

+ Moments of clarity during navigation lectures
+ Dedicating the 8 hours from 8:30 till 5:30 to my navigation career. This would allow me to spend all this time on doing anything for my career, 
+ meaning finishing my studies, reading, building stuff, learning etc.
+ The fact that all the time was taken up by studying did not matter and it made studying fun
+ Projecting my ambitions onto my studies as being the current project I am working on
+ Doing LinkedIn stuff with this new projection, writing about impostor syndrome, fomo etc.
