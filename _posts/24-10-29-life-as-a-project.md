I have FOMO. Fear Of Missing Out. And a lot of it. This is how I got around it and avoided burning out. And how it made me passionate for boring stuff.

Even though this particular story is about tech, I believe this way of shifting perspective applies to many areas in life.

Why do I have FOMO?

I'm a person who has found their passion in tech. This is the passion I am working hard towards making my career. 
Now I do have a specific topic that the main magnet of my passion: Autonomous systems, more specifically: Guidance and Navigation. Deep down, I have known this
since I started studying. Actually, much earlier already. However, it took me long to find out. I was a four year old child when I first ushered the wish to become a pilot. 
When I got older, that wish remained, only the domain changed from wanting to pilot the plane myself to wanting my software to do it. But that wish
took a long time to crystallize. Through years of studying during my bachelor's and master's degree, through multiple different student jobs working with autonomous
cars, drones and robots, there was so much input that my brain had latched onto about 37 different topics that it wanted to learn about and deemed necessary 
for my career. As I said, I knew I wanted to be in tech. And diffusely, I knew I wanted to be an autonomous systems engineer. But I wasn't able to focus because 
there were so many different aspects of tech that shouted for my attention. 

## How This Almost Burned Me Out

Now that my story-about-not-knowing-where-my-passions-lie-even-though-deep-down-in-my-heart-I-have-always-known is out of the way, let's jump to the recent past, more 
specifically, the first part of this year. 

I've never been someone to really buy into new years resolutions. This year was more or less the same. However due to an upcoming internship I had to do as 
part of my master's programme, I was becoming excited to finally experience the real world of engineering that I had been working toward for the past couple
of years. I was so ready to get out of the day to day strut of going to lecures, falling asleep and frantically trying to learn everything necessary to pass 
the exam at the end of the semester, even though I had vowed to keep up during the semester. I started getting ahead of myself, updating my CV and giving it a much
needed facelift, writing multiple cover letters and just diving into the world of exciting companies I might do my internship at. Seeing all the amazing opportunities
out there, I was excited to start learning all about possible topics that I might encounter along the way. Robotics. Control. Navigation. DevOps. Linux. Rust. Cybersecurity. 
The list goes on and on. It was like walking into a room with a thousand different items lying around that all looked amazing, that I just needed to pick up.
I came up with a plan. This plan was split up in 3-day cycles, and I called them: "Learn, Work, Practise". Day 1: Learn. I.e. do online courses, read books etc.
Day 2: Work. Work on my own coding, software and hardware projects, contribute to open source. Day 3: Practise. Practise LeetCode to get up to date on my data structures and 
algorithms, and be ready for interviews (even though I don't live in LeetCode dominated USA). And each of these for one hour (after all, I still had full time internship work _and_ uni stuff to do).
Sound frantic? Absolutely. You can't do an 80 hour C++ course if you do it for one hour, twice a week. You can't build your own autonomous robot like that either (you can, 
but by the time you're done, people will be riding hoverboards and flying cars). This meant getting up at 5AM, getting some exercise, starting at 6AM, studying for an hour, prepare for exams for one hour, 
then doing my "Learn, Work, Practise" thing, then working an 8 hour day, and cramming all free time/chore activities into the evening hours (I had like 5 other hobbies as well).
Oh, and did I mention that I had started finding out about my passion for writing? I was determined to make use of this and post on LinkedIn regularly and document my learning progress _as well_.
Even though I did keep this up for about three months, with every day that passed where I only made small progress and more stuff appeared that I thought I needed to learn,
it didn't work out. My ability for concentration had degraded to the point that I couldn't read a message a coworker sent me without having to re-read it seven times. 
Or thinking through more than 0 nesting layers in my code. Or actually speaking without having to stop and think in the middle of the sentence. This was getting out of hand.

So at the end of my internship and the end of my semester (needless to say, I failed the exam), I decided something needed to change. My fiancee and I were planning our wedding
for the following year, and were planning relocating to my home country South Africa for a year after that. I needed to finish my master's degree before then, and start
earning a living. I still had my master's thesis and about five exams to write within the coming year. It was time to get a grip. Focus. Be grown up about things. 
I never lost my passion through all this, I never lost sight of the career I saw for myself. I just wasn't able to pinpoint where exactly this passion really was. And how
to go about pursuing it in an effective way. 

## Re-Framing Studying as a Project

There were two moments at the beginning of the new semester that I leveraged to turn things around.
This pressure to finally have a deadline when my degree needed to be finished was the first. I saw that this way of working as I had tried before was not the way. I still 
wanted to do all of the things. I asked myself: Why do I want to do all of these things? The core answer was: To follow this passion for tech that I had and to build a 
successful career out of it. So what I decided to do, is to dedicate the time between 08:30 until 17:30 on every single weekday to my tech career. Sounds radical, right?
Not really. This was possible, because the first and most important task for my career were my studies. And this goal happened to align right with my deadline.
My studies shouldn't be a thing that I did because I had just kinda had to to get a piece of paper so that I can do other things. 
They are the core _source of knowledge_ and the foundation that I had to build my career upon. Every single subject I took was basically an online course about a topic I could
leverage, only better. And the best of all: I didn't need to put any time aside for studying, as I did for all my other side projects that I had. I was already putting in
hours of work every day. I basically re-framed my studies as being my current "side project", projected my ambitions onto my degree.
Only now I was able work on this as much as I needed, and spend the remaining time of the eight hours working on side projects, documenting my learning on LinkedIn, writing etc.. In this way, I started working _less_, but getting so much more focused, impactful, career and passion oriented work done. It made me feel good 
about what I did, while letting me drop so many misguided side hustles I was dabbling it. And it was in this way that my head was finally clear enough to find my true passion.

+ Need to switch off the light in the room with the thousand items and walk around with a flashlight to illuminate each item individually, and finding the most exciting one
and maybe the things around it that the light beam caught in the dim border regions.
+ Moments of clarity first by re-framing studying as my new project for my tech career, and during navigation lectures, which focused my attention
+ Dedicating the 8 hours from 8:30 till 5:30 to my navigation career. This would allow me to spend all this time on doing anything for my career, 
+ meaning finishing my studies, reading, building stuff, learning etc.
+ The fact that all the time was taken up by studying did not matter and it made studying fun
+ Projecting my ambitions onto my studies as being the current project I am working on
+ Doing LinkedIn stuff with this new projection, writing about impostor syndrome, fomo etc. 
+ As I see navigation and autonomous systems as part of my professional and even personal identity, and listening to lectures and working on boring uni things
  was now basically a part of my strategy to advance this identity, listening to lectures and doing boring uni work was now basically a part of my identity. 

## Keeping up this view
+ Setting goals to not forget what you're going through boring lectures and tedious, hard work for.
